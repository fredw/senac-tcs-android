Water Reservoir Android
================================================================================

Android app for water reservoir control developed for the **Semester Completion Work** for the **Systems Analysis and Development** course at the **SENAC Blumenau**.
The proposal is to develop a prototype for water control of reservoirs (cisterns, water tanks, etc.) in condominiums.
This repository contains only the Android app of the solution, in which it consumes all system logic through a [RESTful API](https://github.com/fredw/senac-tcs-api).


Improvements / TODO
------------------------------------------------------------
- Implement loading when last data is fetching the API;
- Create others menus with other informations like graphics, etc;
- Use retrofit2 on the right way, using features of JSON model objects;
